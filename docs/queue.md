!!! info "NOTE"

    The Queue component has been removed from v4 because of a lack of activity for Beanstalkd. In future versions of Phalcon (v6+) we will introduce a separate package that uses [queue-interop](https://github.com/queue-interop) to ensure maximum re-usability and extensibility for your queues.
